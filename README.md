# PYTEST
To practice Selenium Python with the webpage: https://automationexercise.com/

AI spends only 1 minute convert manual test cases to automatic scripts. 
However, the results with some errors:
1. Total 26 test cases, AI only generates 15 test cases.
2. Some scripts execute with errors, caused by incorrect webElement locator.

I have fixed above problems, but the code still needs to be improved for code reable and reusable.

# To do:
Refactor current scripts to Page Object Model pattern.
